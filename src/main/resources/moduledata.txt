Numerical data? What about uncertainty and complex relationships? These and many other questions will be addressed using data software and computational tools, with real-world data sets. Short Syllabus: The PPDAC cycle (Spiegelhalter, D., 2019, The Art of Statistics; MacKay, R.J., R.W. Oldford, 2000, “Scientific Method, Statistical Method and the Speed of Light,” Statistical Science) will be used as a framework to highlight and demonstrate the process of dealing with and making sense of data.

Getting data: collection/sampling, experiments/observational studies, data cleaning/recoding, interpreting summary statistics (mode, mean, quartiles, standard deviation, etc.). Categorical data analysis: bar plots, contingency tables, rates/ratios, association, Simpson’s Paradox. Dealing with numerical data: histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, correlation, ecological and atomistic fallacies, simple linear regression. Statistical Inference: probability, conditional probability, prosecutor's fallacy, base rate fallacy, conjunction fallacy, understanding hypothesis tests, interpreting confidence intervals, learning about a population based on a sample, simple simulation. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be incorporated extensively into the content. Students will appreciate that even simple plots and contingency tables can give them valuable insights about data.
