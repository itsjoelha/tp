<h2>
<span style="color:orange;">Project: Grand Rhombus</span>
</h2>
Grand Rhombus aims to provide <span style="color:blue;">CEG Students</span> with an 
<span style="color:green;">Academic Life Planner</span> which is <span style="color:red;"> in-depth 
</span> and <span style="color:red;"> clear </span> to plan their future.

This planner <span style="color:red;">reduces confusion</span> from having to cross-reference multiple sources
so that students <span style="color:red;">do not miss academic opportunities</span>.

</h2>

Here are my contributions to the project

- **Command Parser Class**
  - Designed and implemented a robust command parser that processes user inputs into structured commands.
  - Created a flexible parsing system that handles various command formats with different numbers of arguments.
  - Implemented comprehensive error handling with appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.
  - Integrated logging functionality to track command execution and debugging information.
  - Built a command routing system that directs user inputs to the appropriate command classes.
  - Added validation for numeric inputs and semester ranges (1-8).
  - Implemented argument count validation to prevent command misuse.

- **Workload Command**
  - Developed the Workload command to provide detailed analysis of user's module workload distribution.
  - Created a formatted table display showing workload breakdown by category:
    - Lecture Hours
    - Tutorial Hours
    - Lab Hours
    - Project Hours
    - Preparation Hours
  - Implemented filtering capability to view workload by specific semester.
  - Added validation for semester input ranges (1-8).

- **Specialisation Command**
  - Implemented a comprehensive system to display detailed information about available specializations.
  - Created formatting utilities for consistent text display including:
    - `textWrapDescription()` to handle long descriptions with proper word wrapping.
    - `printHeaderDivider()` for visual separation between sections.
    - `printSpecialisationHeader()` and `printSectionHeader()` for hierarchical information display.

- **Graduation Requirements Command**
  - Developed the ViewGradRequirements command to track and display graduation progress.
  - Implemented analysis of completed modules against graduation requirements.
  - Created a calculation system for total Modular Credits (MCs) earned and needed.
  - Built a formatted display of missing modules in a two-column table layout.
  - Implemented special handling for general education module requirements (GEC and GEN modules).

- **Recommended Schedule Command**
  - Created a formatted table to display the schedules in two columns.
  - Fixed arguments to only 'jc' or 'poly' and correctly displayed respective schedule.

- **Help Command**
  - Designed table formatting for `/help`.

- **Detail Command**
  - Designed table formatting for `/detail`.

- **Waive and Clear Commands**
  - Display error messages upon invalid input.

- **Contributions to team-based tasks**
  - **Code Refactoring**
    - Improved code organization through consistent class structure.
    - Enhanced error handling with dedicated error messages.
    - Implemented consistent logging patterns across classes.
    - Standardized table formatting for consistent user interface.

  - **Test Cases**
    - Created comprehensive test suite for command parsing functionality.
    - Implemented tests for edge cases in user input handling.
    - Developed validation tests for semester range restrictions.
    - Developed tests for workload and graduation requirement tracking logic.

- **User Guide**
  - Contributed to User Guide by adding documentation for commands such as `/schedule` and the example outputs.

- **Developer Guide**
  - Contributed to the Developer Guide on areas like the Appendix: Instructions for manual testing.
