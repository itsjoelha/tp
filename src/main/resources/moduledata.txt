Numerical data? What about uncertainty and complex relationships? These and many other questions will be addressed using data software and computational tools, with real-world data sets. Short Syllabus: The PPDAC cycle (Spiegelhalter, D., 2019, The Art of Statistics; MacKay, R.J., R.W. Oldford, 2000, “Scientific Method, Statistical Method and the Speed of Light,” Statistical Science) will be used as a framework to highlight and demonstrate the process of dealing with and making sense of data.
